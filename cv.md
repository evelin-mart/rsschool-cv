## About me

Since 2016 I was a _system administrator_ in a company group.
Programming has always seemed like an unattainable dream for me.
But now, after several years of technical support, I find myself
smart enough, and studying programming is now more accessible than
ever.
My big passion is _learning_, so i’m aimed to gain an interesting
job and permanently improve my skills.
