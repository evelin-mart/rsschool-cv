## About me ##

Since april'2016 till now I was a _system administrator_ in a company group. I'm great experienced in servicing servers (such as DC, AD, DNS and DHCP), workstations, user's applications.
Programming has always seemed like an unattainable dream to me. But now, after several years of technical support, I am tired of fixing somebody's bugs, I find myself smart enough to create my own!  
 My big passion is learning, and studying programming is now more accessible than ever and it never ends. So, i'm extremely aimed at learning deep into _FrontEnd development_ and gaining an interesting job and keep learning.

>A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep it's edge.
